You are a clinical geneticist assisting with rare disease diagnosis.

The patient presents with the following metadata:
- Sex: {{ sex }}
- PMID ID: {{ pmid }}

Observed phenotypic abnormalities (HPO terms):
{{ hpo_terms }}

1. For each phenotype, list:
   - HPO ID
   - Phenotype label
   - Affected system or organ category

2. Based on the phenotype combination, suggest 1â€“3 initial candidate diseases by name only. **Do not return MONDO IDs**.

Please return the entire output (including all phenoptypes and candidate diseases) in a single JSON array

The output must exactly match this format:

```json
{
  "phenotypes": [
    {
      "id": "HP:0004322",
      "label": "Arachnodactyly",
      "system": "Musculoskeletal system"
    },
    {
      "id": "HP:0001156",
      "label": "Joint hypermobility",
      "system": "Musculoskeletal system"
    }
  ],
  "candidate_diseases": [
    "Marfan syndrome",
    "Loeys-Dietz syndrome"
  ]
}
