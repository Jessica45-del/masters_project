The patient presents with the following metadata:
- Sex: {{ sex }}

Please would you provide a ranked list of candidate diseases for this phenotypic profile for observed phenotypic abnormalities
(HPO terms):
{{ hpo_terms }}

1. For each phenotype, list:
   - HPO ID
   - Phenotype label
   - Affected system or organ category

2. Based on the phenotype combination, suggest 1â€“3 initial candidate diseases by name only. **Do not return MONDO IDs**.

Please return the entire output (including all phenotypes and candidate diseases) in a single JSON array
Provide a score that is the reciprocal of the rank (1/rank)

The output must exactly match the following format:

```json
{
  "phenotypes": [
    {
      "id": "HP:0004322",
      "label": "Arachnodactyly",
      "system": "Musculoskeletal system",
    },
    {
      "id": "HP:0001156",
      "label": "Joint hypermobility",
      "system": "Musculoskeletal system"
    }
  ],
  "candidate_diseases": [
  {"label": "Leigh syndrome", "score": 0.95},
  {"label": "Mitochondrial encephalopathy", "score": 0.74}
]
}
