The patient presents with the following metadata:
- Sex: {{ sex }}

Please would you provide a ranked list of candidate diseases for this phenotypic profile for observed phenotypic abnormalities
(HPO terms):
{{ hpo_terms }}

1. For each phenotype, list:
   - HPO ID
   - Phenotype label
   - Affected system or organ category

2. Based on the phenotype combination, suggest 10 initial candidate diseases by name only.
The returned disease name must exactly match the OMIM title for that subtype, including Roman numeral designations (e.g., Type I, Type III).
**Do not return MONDO IDs**.
