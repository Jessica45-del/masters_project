Do **not** include any explanation, markdown, or additional text.
Provide a score that is the reciprocal of the rank (1/rank)

The output must exactly match this format:

```json
[
  {
    "gene_symbol": "<GENE_SYMBOL>",
    "score": 0.9
  },
  {
    "gene_symbol": "<GENE_SYMBOL>",
    "score": 0.8
  }
]
```
